About Matrix:

Matrix.org is an open standard for interoperable, decentralised, real-time communication
over IP, supporting group chat, file transfer, voice and video calling, integrations to
other apps, bridges to other communication systems and much more. It can be used to power
Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere
you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the
conversation history.

Matrix defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of
Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you
create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.

Thanks,

Matrix
